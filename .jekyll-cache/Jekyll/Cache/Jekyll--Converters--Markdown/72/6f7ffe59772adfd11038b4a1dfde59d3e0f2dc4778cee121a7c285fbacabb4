I"º<p><a href="http://philogb.github.com/band-nexus">Band Nexus</a> is a data visualization that explores relationships
between bands and artists.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/bandtree/1.jpg" alt="Tree Image" /></p>

<p>Each node represents a band or an artist. Two nodes are connected if for
example an artist took part of the band at some point in time or collaborated in some way
(for example by touring together, or did a cover song of the other band,
etc).</p>

<p>The relations data are stored as static files, but were taken from the
<a href="http://musicbrainz.org">MusicBrainz</a> database. The visualization was
created with the <a href="http://thejit.org">JavaScript InfoVis Toolkit</a>.</p>
