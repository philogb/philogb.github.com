Every year, Americans fill out income tax forms and make a payment to the IRS.
Where does it all go? Using data provided by WhatWePayFor.com, [Luz Caballero](http://uxnerd.com/) and I created a data visualization
that will make it easier to understand how the government spends our tax money.

## The Visualization

This visualization is made of two components. First, a tree layout shows, for each given year,
how the budget (blue) is divided on each function (green), subfunction (yellow), and "account"
(the most granular subdivision accounted for in the budget, which gives an idea of the
use to which the money is put) (red):

The height of each node/section in the tree is proportional to the amount of the
budget spent on that function, subfunction or "account". **You can click on the nodes
to navigate and filter functions and subfunctions**. To go back you can right-click or
click in the back arrow on the left of the visualization.

The second component of the application is a timeline that puts the amounts you are
visualizing in the tree in a temporal context, showing the evolution of that particular
spending category through time. **Click on the bars representing the different years to navigate
through time**.

We wanted to allow our users to compare today's
spending to the 80s' without artifacts caused by inflation, and changes in population and GDP.
This is why our visualization shows inflation-adjusted USD, gives you the the option to see
spending in USD, in USD per capita, or as a percentage of the time's GDP. Plus, we wanted to give
our users a good shot at pinpointing if/when spending changes are a
consequence of government policy or of the economic climate. This is why you can overlay
indicators like debt, GDP, inflation and yr/yr population change, to give you an idea of how they
affect and are influenced by spending trends.

## Interaction

What makes this application most interesting is the interaction between the components, which
are tightly coupled.

When a function is selected, the timeline will adapt to show the budget
spending trend for that particular function over the years.

When clicking on a timeline element, the tree will animate to show
how the budget is spent on each function, subfunction and account, for the
selected year.

If you are interested in comparing how the budget changed between two different
moments in time, there is an option to transition between years using colors, red and green,
to highlight a decrease or increase of total budget spending for each item.

## Demo Video

We created a video that shows how to navigate and filter data and some interesting finds we made
using our visualization. [Click here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUtwn7wB9Hs&hd=1) to see the video in HD.
