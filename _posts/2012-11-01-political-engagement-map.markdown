I worked on an [exploratory data
visualization](https://election.twitter.com/map) at Twitter that tracks
engagement in the US for tweets from the candidates. [You can see the
article on the Twitter blog here](http://blog.twitter.com/2012/11/visualizing-2012-election.html).

There are some interesting insights from the visualization summarized in
the blog post too. For example, searching for tweets with the "coal"
keyword shows more engagement on the states that are leading producers
of coal:

Other interesting searches ares ones for [Pell Grant](https://election.twitter.com/map/#t240972218933329922&kpell%20grant) or
[God](https://election.twitter.com/map/#t245509634897633281&kgod&m4).

You can also take a look at the topics that interest more a given state
by clicking on it. For example, [here's what we get about New York](https://election.twitter.com/map/#t258345565794992128&sNY&m4):

This visualization has been featured in [NYTimes](http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/01/new-data-shows-which-candidates-tweets-resonated-most-with-electorate/) and [Wired](http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2012/11/twitter-launches-election-map-to-track-candidates-state-by-state-messaging/) among other places.
