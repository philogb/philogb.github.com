I've been doing research on [line integral convolution visualization techniques via texture advection](https://github.com/philogb/lic#readme).
These are interesting techniques to visualize
vector fields. The resulting visualizations are very similar to this
physics experiment that uses iron "sand" to visualize a magnetic dipole vector
field:

These same techniques can be applied to visualize flows. [Here's an example](http://philogb.github.com/LIC/fluid.html).

If you'd like to know more about this project you can access a related
blog post [here](http://blog.thejit.org/2012/08/14/playing-with-line-integral-convolutions/).

The papers implemented are:
