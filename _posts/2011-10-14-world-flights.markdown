World Flights is a data visualization that shows flying routes
information for various airlines around the world. For 200 airlines,
more than 57.000 flights and 6.000 destinations are displayed.

One important aspect of this visualization is the work put into trying
to simplify the navigation and exploration of the data set.

You can select airlines to be displayed in the map by using the right
menu. The top part of the menu displays the current selected
airlines, clicking on them will rotate the earth to better display the
cities served by the selected airline.

You can also zoom-in and hover the cities to see more information about
them.
