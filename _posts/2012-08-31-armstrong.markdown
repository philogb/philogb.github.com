I created a data visualization that shows the reaction on
Twitter after NASA announced that Neil Armstrong passed away on August 25th 2012.

There were more than 1.6 million tweets mentioning Neil Armstrong
on a 48 hour period. Each tweet is represented by a yellow dot in this video:

</iframe>

The video team worked on this idea to create a more polished video for the
visualization that you can find in [Twitter's blog](http://blog.twitter.com/2012/08/remembering-first-man-on-moon_31.html).
