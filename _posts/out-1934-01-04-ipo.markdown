We released two visualizations accompanying Twitter's IPO roadshow
presentations. These videos were
used in the roadshow following the IPO and are an introduction to what
Twitter is and its main features. One of the core values represented by these
visualizations is "Reach every person on the planet".

The first visualization we built shows "connectedness". How
it all started in San Francisco and how our user base grew accross
the globe.

The visualization is part of the introduction to
Twitter's IPO roadshow video:

The longer IPO roadshow presentation features the CEO Dick Costolo explaining
Twitter's core features. For this presentation we also created a
visualization, this time showing the reach for the "Four more years"
Tweet by Barack Obama.
