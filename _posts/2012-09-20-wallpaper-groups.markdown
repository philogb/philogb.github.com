While exploring [symmetry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry) I got interested in [Wallpaper Groups](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallpaper_groups) and how these were generated. There are 17 different plane groups:

I worked on a shader based implementation of

You can access the app by [clicking on this link](http://www.senchalabs.org/philogl/PhiloGL/examples/groups/). Remember that you

I recommend you that before using the app you watch this quick tutorial on how to use the tool to create your own wallpapers here:
