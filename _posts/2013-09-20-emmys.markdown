At Twitter we've been releasing small interactive data visualizations that
usually provide context or complement blog posts.

We created a [visualization of most mentioned #DoctorWho Tweets](http://twitter.github.io/interactive/doctorwho/) for the
50yr Doctor Who anniversary.

Also there's Simon Rogers' blog post about [Twitter's biggest moments](https://blog.twitter.com/2013/behind-the-numbers-how-to-understand-big-moments-on-twitter) which
was complemented with an [interactive comparing biggest
moments](http://twitter.github.io/interactive/tpms/).

We also worked on an interactive for the Emmys. [This interactive](http://twitter.github.io/interactive/emmys2013/)
shows TV shows by category, plus total and average number of Tweets per
episode. Here's the [blog post](https://blog.twitter.com/2013/visualizing-tweets-around-emmy-nominated-shows) also done by the Twitter media team.

Most the work here is generally done within the week, having these as
"small" visualizations that complement stories.
