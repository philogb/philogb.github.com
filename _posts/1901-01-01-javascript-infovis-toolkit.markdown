The [JavaScript InfoVis Toolkit](http://thejit.org/) provides tools for creating
Interactive Data Visualizations for the Web.

The toolkit implements advanced features of
information visualization like [TreeMaps](http://thejit.org/static/v20/Jit/Examples/Treemap/example1.html), an adapted visualization
of trees based on the [SpaceTree](http://thejit.org/static/v20/Jit/Examples/Spacetree/example1.html), a focus+context technique
to plot [Hyperbolic Trees](http://thejit.org/static/v20/Jit/Examples/Hypertree/example1.html), a radial layout of trees with
advanced animations -called [RGraph](http://thejit.org/static/v20/Jit/Examples/RGraph/example1.html) and [other visualizations](http://thejit.org/demos.html).


In November 2010 [the toolkit was acquired by the Sencha Labs
Foundation](http://blog.thejit.org/2010/11/06/sencha-acquires-the-javascript-infovis-toolkit/).


The JavaScript InfoVis Toolkit has been chosen as a mentoring
organization and project for the Google Summer of Code 2011.
