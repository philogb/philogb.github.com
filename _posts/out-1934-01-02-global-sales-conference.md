We worked on some visuals that were presented during Twitter's Global
Sales Conference. The first visualization shows the difference between
the reach of an organic Tweet:

and a promoted one:

showing approximately 12x increase in impressions for promoted Tweets.
Here's a video of the animation:

The second visualization shows how different moments are lived across
the world in our platform: interest, brand, campaign, prospect and
customer moments:
